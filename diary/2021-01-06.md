[[on-self-esteem]]:
Self esteem is the property that one esteems one-self. There is a case in
taking esteem as synonymous with value. My thoughts about value is that it
is highly subjective: Something provides me value if I'd rather have it than
not. Ones worth would then be defined as to how much value one can provide
to other people. There is a case, that one provides more value to other people
when engaging empathically instead of analytically. Conclusion: Be kind to
others. It is the foundation for self esteem.
